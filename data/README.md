## ðŸ“¦ Dataset Access

Due to GitHub's file size limits, the cleaned dataset is hosted externally.

ðŸ‘‰ [Click here to download `data.zip`](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1CEEghOidlx3ZKLbr0e76PEmyOjTtwWpl)

### ðŸ“‚ After Downloading:
1. Extract the ZIP file
2. Move the contents into your local `data/` folder so the structure looks like:


Capstone-Malicous_URL_Detection/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ cleaned_data.csv

This will enable all training and inference scripts to work properly.
